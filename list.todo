Picross:
Core stuff:
    ✔ Cell state representation
        -> Checked, crossed and empty states
    ✔ Grid state representation
        -> 1D array of cells
        -> Horizontal and vertical hints
        -> Row/column getters
        -> Various checks
    ✔ Grid/cell state manipulation
        -> Change cell states
        -> Change hints (autocheck valididty)
    ✔ Hint generation from grid state
    ✔ Is solvable and is solved checks
I/O:
    ✔ Text grid formatter
    ✔ XML grid serialization
    ✔ XML grid deserialization

            ☐ Modify grid command
                Micro shell interpreting subcommands:
                    ☐ $ check <x> <y>                           # Check cell at coordinates (x;y)
                    ☐ $ cross <x> <y>                           # Cross cell at coordinates (x;y)
                    ☐ $ clear <x> <y>                           # Clear cell at coordinates (x;y)
                    ☐ $ <check|cross|clear> <x0:xn> <y0:xn>     # Check/cross/clear cells in coordinate range [x0 ; xn] × [y0 ; yn]
                    ✔ $ display [nohints]                       # Display grid with hints by default, without them when nohints is specified
                    ✔ $ hints <h|v> <n> <values>                # Set horizontal or vertical hints for row or column n to provided values
                    ✔ $ hints generate                          # Generate hints from grid state, overwriting current ones
                    ✔ $ commit                                  # Write changes to current grid
                    ✔ $ rollback                                # Discard changes and revert state back to last saved grid
                    ✔ $ exit                                    # Exit
    Shell toolkit:
        ☐ Think about it
Solving:
    ✔ Generic solver
    ☐ Iterative solver
    ☐ Inference engine
Cleanup & enhancement:
    Important:
        ✔ Use smart pointers in CLIMenu, CommandSequence and SolveGridCommand
        ✔ Alternatively ensure CLIMenu and CommandSequence destructors don't leak
        ✔ Also use smart pointers on instanciation of the main menu
        ✔ Put comments here and there
        ✔ Custom exceptions
        ✔ Use std::string::operator+ instead of abusing stringstreams
        ✔ Include folder name in all include-protection macros
        ✔ CMake build
        ✔ Inline fully specialized templates
        ✔ Make sure all polymorphically derived classes have a virtual destructor
        ☐ Reorganize all kinds of utils in the "tools" folder
        ☐ Ensure all argument copies are compiler-made when needed
    Nice:
        ✔ Generalize bounded input method (used in CLIMenu and SolveCommand)
        ✔ Better usage of std::endl (new line vs. buffer flushing)
        ✔ Cross-platform handling of new lines (+ fix hardcoded \n's)
        ☐ Make use of <algorithm>, <functional>, lambdas, etc where possible
        ☐ Make CLI-related stuff its own library, with custom templated state et al
        ☐ Aliase templates where appropriate (shorten CLI* names)
        ✔ Have exhaustive #includes in all files
        ✔ Ensure syntactical coherence on reference and pointers (+ there should not be pointers anywhere)
        ✔ Ensure class members declaration order and syntactical coherence
        ✔ Remove empty constructors and destructors (unless virtual or required)
Project management:
    ✔ Set up a git repo
    ✔ Come up with tests
    ✔ Set up continuous integration because why not
